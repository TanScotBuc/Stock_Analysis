# Stock Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
My friend Steve needed my help to analyze stock market data in order to help advise his parents, who are preparing to invest. I already had a usable code for analyzing a few companies. Using that as a base I refactored the code into something that could analyze thousands of companies in one loop. The refactored code was far more efficent and even integrated some formatting to make the final product more readable.
### Results
After running my analysis it was very easy to see that the stock market overall performed much worse in 2018 than in 2017. The data for 2017 linked [here](Stock_Analysis_Visual_Aids/all_stocks_2017.png)
